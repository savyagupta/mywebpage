        <p>Hello everyone! I am Savya, studying in The Valley School, Bangalore. I was born in 2003. Apart from Studying in eleventh grade, I play cricket and am interested in squash, chess, Kabaddi, Hockey, Badminton and drums. I love outdoor sports and
            adventure trips. I love to try different kinds of food. Continental is one my most favourite cuisine. In my free time, I like to play board games with my parents like chess, scrable and monopoly or watch a movie. Whenever my friends are available,
            I go and play with them. In my school, there are no exams till ninth grade. So when others were busy studying, I used to chill at home and keep playing. I also like to travel a lot. I have visited six countries so far. All of them were a new
            experience for me. I leanrt about their culture and lifestyle and that helped me be more aware of various things in the outside world like what customs they follow, what language they speak, what knowledge they have, etc. I am really eager
            to try out different varities of food. Whenever I travel, I try different cuisines.</p><br>

        <p>Once, when I was in fifth grade, I played cricket in my apartment for eight hours. I went down after breakfast at around nine, and came home for lunch at three. After about half an hour, I again went down and came back home at seven thirty in
            the night. The entire day we played cricket. It was really fun. I also love playing chess with my grandmother. She comes to our place either in my summer vacation or in my winter vacation to entertain me. Once my grandmother and I played seventeen
            games of chess in one day. It was an amazing experience.</p><br>

        <p>My father works in Wipro and my mother is house wife. My mother used to work in Infosys but after a few years she left because she wanted to spend time with me. Later she started her own business of selling fresh Salads and Sandwiches called Sajuso.
            She left that too and now she is a house wife. My father too tried his own business of giving fresh meals like lunch and dinner. That didn't work out too well and he stopped it. He joined Wipro thereafter. Now both my parents conduct a few
            coaching sessions for parents. In fact they have a website called nurturingsouls.in. They too were born in North India. My parents try to spend time with me whenever possible. Sometimes, we converse on various topics which help me in daily
            life.
