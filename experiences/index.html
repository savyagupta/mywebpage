    <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Paragliding, 27th April,2018</p>
    <P style="margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -250px; color: crimson;"> - On 17th February, 2018, we went for an excursion to Agustya from school. While coming back we unfortunately boarded the wrong train. Due to some chaos half of us were left on the train when it started to move. We then asked somebody to pull the
        chain. When we later boarded the right train, some people in my class started cries as they were reminscing about the incident. It was a memorable experience for me.</P>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: blue;"> - On September 7th, 2018, I gave my first exam. I was in 9th grade. I got an overall percentage of 86%</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: #F97F51;"> - On 21st January 2017, I played a chess tournament for the first time and I came second. It was an informal tournament. I got a book called 'Breaking Through'. The book was about how the three sisters played chess and got better at it.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: #40407a;"> - On 26th January 2018, I played drums on a stage for the first time. The song I played was a Marathi song "Ashwini Ye Na". The occation was an annual day of my drums class. I was a support drummer. The drums class was called Geetanjali Harmonica
        Institute of music. My teacher's name was Mr. Ashish Gosh.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 120px;">Snorkeling, 2th April,2015</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; margin-top: -300px; color: #c44569;"> - On 21st April 2018, my family and I went to Nathu La pass in Sikkim. There I got to touch snow for first time. It was astonishing. The beauty was mind blowing. It was an eight day trip to Sikkim.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: #3d3d3d;"> - I hit my first century on April 7th 2019, in the KYCA ground. The ground was pretty small. I loved it. I hit 9 sixes and 4 fours. I ultimately got out because I hit the ball over a side net which according to the rules was out. We lost the forty
        over match.

    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: #84817a;"> - On 16th and 17th November 2019, I attended my first Model United Nations(MUN). It was in 37th Crescent Banquet Hall, Koramangala, Bangalore. It was hosted by Indian Academy Of Public Speaking. I completely enjoyed it.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 500px; color: #82589F;"> - On February 27th 2020, I gave my first board exams ever in The Valley School. The centre was in my school. The first paper was of English Language. My seat was in the middle of the hall. The last exam was Biology which was on 30th March. The exams
        scheduled between 19th Marcg and 30th March was postponed. There were 4 exams left. This was due to the Cornoavirus outbreak which originated in China. It affected almost evry country in the world. The United States Of America was affected the
        worst with one third of the total global cases. Fortunately, the death percent of this virus was only 2%. Countries including India went into lockdown and the economy was hit badly.</p>
